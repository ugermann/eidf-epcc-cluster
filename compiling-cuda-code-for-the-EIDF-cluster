# Compiling CUDA code in C++ for use on the EIDF cluster

As you already will have noticed by the time to get to this page, interacting with the EIDF cluster is a bit more involved 
that what you may be used to, and there are tradeoffs between efficient use of the cluster and your personal convenience. 
For cluster efficiency, most of the non-GPU work will be done outside EIDF and provided as part of the underlying Docker images.

Start with an appropriate nvidia image; see the list here: https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda/tags
We assume an ubunut-based image here, e.g. nvidia/cuda:12.3.2-cudnn9-devel-ubuntu20.04
